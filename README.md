# PayTheBills
This software will help you and your roommates to manage and keep track of your flat's payments.
How does it work?
Every roommate signed up for the same flat.
After every payment you will fill in the payment details and how you want to split the payment.
For every roommate, there is a balance when the balance is negative the roommate owns money for the other roommates, and on the contrary,
 when the balance is positive the roommates own him money.
